### Methodology

At Chicken Wild Tournament, we follow a structured and agile methodology designed to deliver an engaging and user-centric gaming experience. Our approach is divided into four key phases:

1. **Game Concept Development**: We start by defining the core gameplay mechanics and system for Chicken Wild Tournament. This phase includes player feedback sessions, analysis of popular gaming trends, and competitive research to ensure that our 1v1 egg battle concept is both enjoyable and unique.

2. **Game Design and Prototyping**: Based on our initial concept, we design the game interface, egg ranking system, and user flow. Our goal is to create a smooth, visually appealing, and intuitive experience. During this phase, we establish game rules, player progression, and define a clear system for winning and losing.

3. **Development and Iterative Testing**: Using agile methodologies, we build and test the game in stages.

4. **Launch and Continuous Optimization**: After launch, we monitor the game’s performance, player engagement, and satisfaction through key metrics. Our team remains proactive in making updates to enhance gameplay, add new features, and fix any issues. Regular optimization ensures that Chicken Wild Tournament remains engaging and provides a fair experience for all players.

This methodology enables us to adapt flexibly to player needs while maintaining a strong focus on quality, performance, and user enjoyment.

### Testing

To ensure the reliability and functionality of **Chicken Wild Tournament**, a suite of tests was implemented using **Jest**. These tests focus on verifying critical features and behaviors in the application. Below are the main aspects covered:

#### Test Overview

1. **Player Management Tests**:
   - Verified the initialization of the player list (`listaJugadores`).
   - Ensured correct behavior for core player management functionalities.

2. **Audio Functionality Tests**:
   - Mocked the `Audio` API to simulate sound playback.
   - Tested functions to ensure the correct audio files are played with proper configurations:
     - `audioOpenWindow`: Plays a sound when a window is opened.
     - `audioCloseWindow`: Plays a sound when a window is closed.
     - `audioClearPlayers`: Plays a sound when players are cleared.

### Next

With the initial phases of **Chicken Wild Tournament** successfully completed, the following steps will help us refine the game, enhance player engagement, and prepare for future growth. Here’s our roadmap moving forward:

1. **Review of Gameplay and Player Feedback**: We will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the gameplay experience, player feedback, and engagement metrics to understand what’s working well and where improvements are needed.

2. **Continuous Gameplay Optimization**: Based on feedback and performance data, we’ll make adjustments to game mechanics, egg ranking balance, and user interface elements to maximize player satisfaction and ensure a smooth, fair gameplay experience.

3. **Feature Expansion**: We plan to introduce new game modes, egg types, and special events to keep the experience fresh and exciting. Additionally, we’ll explore new ways for players to engage, such as leaderboard rankings and achievement rewards.

4. **Documentation and Community Building**: We will create resources to help players understand the game rules. Additionally, fostering an active community through forums, social media, and events will help build a loyal player base and provide valuable insights for future updates.

This approach ensures that Chicken Wild Tournament remains engaging, fair, and scalable, creating a solid foundation for continued growth and player satisfaction.
